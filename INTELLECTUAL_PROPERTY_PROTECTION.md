## **Additional Protection Strategies**

### **Option 1: Time-Limited Access**
```bash
# Set up demo to expire after 30 days
# Add expiration check in the application
# Automatic shutdown after evaluation period
```

### **Option 2: Read-Only Demo**
- **Live testing only** - No code download
- **Screenshots/videos** for initial screening
- **Controlled access** to specific features

### **Option 3: Partial Code Release**
- **Core architecture** - Show design patterns
- **Key algorithms** - Demonstrate problem-solving
- **Documentation** - Prove capabilities
- **Keep advanced features** private

## **What Firecrawl Can Legally Do**

### **‚úÖ Permitted Uses**
- Test the live demo functionality
- Review code for hiring assessment
- Evaluate technical capabilities
- Discuss implementation during interview

### **‚ùå Prohibited Uses**
- Copy code for production use
- Modify or distribute the software
- Reverse engineer the implementation
- Use without permission after evaluation

4. **Document your process** thoroughly

### **For the Interview**
1. **Discuss your approach** and decisions
2. **Explain problem-solving** (email loop fix)
3. **Show technical depth** and architecture
4. **Demonstrate communication** skills

### **For Protection**
1. **Monitor usage** of your demo
2. **Keep records** of all interactions
3. **Be prepared** to discuss licensing if needed
4. **Focus on getting hired** rather than just protecting code
